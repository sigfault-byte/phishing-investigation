# Phishing Investigation Archive

This repository documents real-world phishing campaigns for educational and research purposes.  
It highlights how attackers exploit trust at various layers of communication, including email headers, DNS, redirect chains, and hosting infrastructure.

The project also includes a curated lexicon covering how email works, with clear explanations of key protocols (SMTP, SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and commonly abused headers used in phishing detection and authentication workflows.
