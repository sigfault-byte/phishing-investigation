## Phishing Investigation Archive

This repository documents real-world phishing campaigns for educational and research purposes.  
It aims to expose how attackers abuse trust across different layers of communication â€” from email headers and DNS to redirect chains and hosting infrastructure.

You'll also find a growing [Lexicon](Lexicon/Email.md) that explains how email works, including key protocols (SMTP, SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and important headers used in phishing detection and authentication.
